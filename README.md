# MSDS410 – Statistics and Data Modeling for Supervised Learning

This repository showcases selected coursework and projects from MSDS410, demonstrating **applied statistical modeling** and **supervised learning** skills.

---

## 📌 Overview

MSDS410 focuses on traditional statistics and data modeling techniques for **supervised learning problems** in observational and experimental research. The core objective is to build, evaluate, and interpret predictive models with clearly defined **explanatory** and **response** variables.

This repository highlights practical applications of:

* Predictive modeling for quantitative and categorical outcomes.
* Statistical reasoning and research design.
* Reproducible data analysis and clear communication of results.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

Through the work in this repository, I demonstrate proficiency in:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization.
* Multiple linear regression for quantitative prediction.
* Logistic and multinomial regression for classification problems.
* Observational and experimental research design.
* Variable transformation and feature engineering.
* Model diagnostics and assumption checking.
* Model selection and comparison.
* Model validation and performance assessment.
