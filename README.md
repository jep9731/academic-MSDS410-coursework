# MSDS410 – Statistics and Data Modeling for Supervised Learning

This repository showcases selected coursework and projects from **MSDS 410: Supervised Learning Methods**, demonstrating **applied statistical modeling**, **predictive analytics**, and **supervised learning skills**.

---

## 📌 Overview

MSDS 410 introduces traditional statistics and data modeling for supervised learning problems as employed in observational and experimental research. With supervised learning, there is a clear distinction between explanatory and response variables. The objective is to predict responses, whether they be quantitative (as with multiple regression) or categorical (as with logistic regression and multinomial logit models).
Students explore data, identify appropriate models, and validate models using techniques for:

* Observational and experimental research design
* Data visualization and exploratory data analysis
* Variable transformation and feature engineering
* Model diagnostics and assumption checking
* Model selection and validation strategies

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

Through the work in this repository, I demonstrate proficiency in:

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and data visualization
* **Multiple linear regression** for quantitative prediction
* **Logistic regression** for binary classification
* **Multinomial logit models** for multi-class classification
* **Poisson and Negative Binomial regression** for count data
* **Zero-Inflated regression models** for overdispersed count data
* Observational and experimental **research design**
* **Variable transformation** and feature engineering
* **Model diagnostics** and assumption checking (residual analysis, multicollinearity, influential observations)
* **Model selection** strategies (automated procedures and manual selection)
* **Model validation** and performance assessment (ROC curves, cross-validation)
* Analysis of Variance (**ANOVA**) and Analysis of Covariance (**ANCOVA**)
* **Unequal slopes models** and interaction effects
